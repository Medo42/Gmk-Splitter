How to use

Gmk Splitter is distributed as a jar file (gmksplit.jar). To run the tool,
you need to have a recent version of Java installed.

The basic command line is
java -jar <path_to_gmksplitter>/gmksplit.jar <input> <output>
Either the input or the output parameter must be a filename ending with ".gmk".

If the .gmk file is given as input, it will be disassembled into the directory
given by the output parameter. This directory must not already exist, since the
tool won't overwrite files or directories for safety reasons.

If the .gmk file is given as output, it will be created by the tool from the
directory given as input parameter.


Limitations/Bugs

This tool has only been tested with GM8 .gmk files so far. Reading older
versions *should* work, but the output .gmk file will always be in GM8 format.
Not all data contained in GM8 files is converted yet, and some (like timestamps)
will never be supported because they are not useful for the purpose of this tool.

IDs of resources, instances and tiles can change in the reassembling process if
they conflict with other IDs. This usually happens when two versions that have
evolved in parallel are merged. As long as your game doesn't reference resources,
instances or tiles by their numeric ID, and you don't rely on a specific execution
order of the events among instances, these changes shouldn't affect the function
of your game. You will be notified by the tool if IDs change.

GMK Splitter hasn't been extensively tested yet and may very well contain serious bugs.
Don't rely on its output being equivalent to the input. You should e.g. keep
backup copies of .gmk files even if you put the file tree under version control.
(Keeping the .gmk file itself under verison control is problematic since it
causes merge conflicts).

These features are currently not supported but will be in later versions:
- Triggers
- Timelines
- Included files

These features are not supported and might not make it later either:
- Action Libraries

These features won't be supported:
- ID of last instance/tile
- Timestamps (last modification of individual resources)
